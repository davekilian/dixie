Dixie
=====

Dixie is a Dropbox-powered wiki. It uses a folder on your Dropbox for storage
and lets your author wiki pages using a mixture of Markdown for text and
LaTeX for math. Sharing a wiki is as easy as sharing a folder from Dropbox,
and your wiki's content never leaves your hands.

Wiki Structure
--------------

Dixie supports multiple logically-separated wikis. Individual wikis follow
Mediawiki-style conventions:

* There is no limit on the number of wikis a user can have, beyond storage
  limits in the user's Dropbox account. Every wiki has a unique name.
* Each wiki contains pages with unique titles. There is no hierarchy between
  wiki pages.
* New pages are added by first editing an existing page to link to the
  new (noneistent) page. Clicking this link allows the user to edit the page,
  creating it upon saving it.
* Multimedia attachments can be stored and linked to within the wiki. Users
  can also embed external resources.

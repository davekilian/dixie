TODO
====

* Recompile highlight.js, but this time remove esoteric languages that are
  messing with the highlighting of languages people actually use. It is 
  almost acceptable for Java to show up as C#, but why is ruby being highlighted
  as vala??
* Looks like Dribble crashes when an authorized user hits the get started
  link on the about page.
* Editing pages
* Write more TODOs
